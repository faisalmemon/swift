Random Notes
============

This is not supposed to be organized or tutorial in nature.  Just a random
list of things I thought whilst hacking through the example programs and
scripts.  I hope to turn this into a FAQ-type format in the future.

println
-------
When you do a println it is not evaluated on the right hand side.  Instead you need to look at the console
view to see the text printed.

Unicode
-------
You can supply unicode data in strings using \uDDDD where D is a digit.
